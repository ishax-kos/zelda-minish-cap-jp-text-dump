-- Glyph graphics start at 0x692C00
The first 16 characters (1x2 in size) are used as control characters in dialogue boxes.
In the character naming screen, they render as valid characters on their own.


Im told that the string table for the jp rom starts at 0x9B1A30. It is a contiguous 2d array
English ver: 9B1A30 en 

-- Special Characters in dialogue boxes:
00 Terminates string of text.
    Starting the text with 00 will cause no box to be drawn. Game waits for user input as if a box was there.

01 Not clear.
    Seems identical in behavior to 00.

02 Set the color according to the next byte.
    00 white/default
    01 red
    02 green
    03 blue
    04 black (not visible)
    05 white on transparent bg
    06 white on dark red bg
    07 red on dark red bg
    08 - 0D is repeat of 00 - 05
    0E green
    0F white on transparent

03 No obvious effect.
    It consumes the following byte, so it must be a modifier.

04 Changes text box position. Consumes 2 additional bytes.

05 Indicates a spot for selecting from a number of options.
    Consumes 3 additional bytes. Draws an arrow.

06 Prints out a preset word such as the player character's name.
    00 is The player's name. I did not find any other meaningful words in the first 14.

07 Prints out an ellipsis (...) and terminates the string.

08 Nothing, Same as 03.

09 Nothing, Same as 03.

0A Line break.

0B through 0F are modifiers that select from different ranges of characters. They consume one additional byte which selects the character. Below I give the offset of the printed characters in the rom and their dimensions in tiles.

    0B offset 0x6AAB80, size 1x2. 
        Wind hylian glyphs.

    0C offset 0x6A2700, size 2x2. 
        Pictograms such as buttons.
        
    0D offset 0x699580, size 2x2. 
        The first kanji block. The first character is blank.
    
    0E offset 0x6A1580, size 2x2. 
        The remaining kanji in the game.
    
    0F offset 0x696C00, size 1x2. 
        Various symbols including a repeat of the first 16 characters.
